        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
          Neurons are fundamental units of the brain and nervous system, responsible
          for receiving sensory input, sending motor commands, and transforming
          electrical signals. This project investigates neuronal dynamics using the
          FitzHugh-Nagumo model, exploring how different input currents influence
          neuronal behavior, with a focus on understanding the emergence of chaos
          and signal transmission in neural networks.

        <h2>Biological Background</h2>
        <p>
          Neurons act as electrical capacitors, storing charge until a threshold
          is reached. When this threshold is met, the stored charge is released
          through an action potential. This process involves complex ionic
          movements: the neuron&apos;s exterior is positively charged, and as positive
          ions flow in through sodium channels, the internal voltage increases.
        </p>
        <p>
          After signal transmission, neurotransmitters facilitate the return to
          the resting state through negative ion channels. This intricate process
          can include a refractory period where the cell membrane becomes
          predominantly negatively charged.
        </p>

      <section id="mathematical_model">
        <h2>Mathematical Model</h2>
        <p>
          We utilized the FitzHugh-Nagumo model, a simplified two-dimensional
          version of the Hodgkin-Huxley equations. This model captures essential
          neuronal dynamics while reducing computational complexity:
        </p>
        <pre>
          du/dt = v - (u^3 / 3) - w + I(t)
          dw/dt = ε * (u + α - β * w)
        </pre>
        <p>
          Key parameters include <code>ε = 0.005</code>, <code>α = 0.1</code>,
          and <code>β = 0.5</code>, carefully chosen to represent neuronal behavior.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="dynamics">
        <h2>Neuronal Dynamics</h2>
        <p>
          Our analysis revealed fascinating behavioral transitions under varying
          input currents:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            For small current inputs (I &lt; 0.10421), the system converges to
            a stable equilibrium point.
          </li>
          <li>
            As input current increases, the system transitions to a limit cycle,
            demonstrating a Hopf Bifurcation.
          </li>
          <li>
            A positive correlation exists between input current magnitude and
            oscillation frequency.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="chaos_analysis">
        <h2>Chaos Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          By introducing square wave input currents, we explored the system&apos;s
          chaotic behavior. With large wave periods, the system maintains a
          limit cycle. However, as the period decreases, chaotic dynamics emerge,
          characterized by aperiodic potential propagations.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="neuron_network">
        <h2>Neuron Network Dynamics</h2>
        <p>
          We extended our model by linking multiple neurons, simulating signal
          transmission through synapses. Remarkably, while the first neuron
          might exhibit chaotic behavior, subsequent neurons in the network
          tend to stabilize the signal.
        </p>
        <p>
          This stabilization occurs because neurons act as low-pass filters,
          naturally smoothing out high-frequency noise and chaotic inputs.
          This mechanism may be crucial for preventing uncontrolled neuronal
          oscillations.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="conclusions">
        <h2>Conclusions</h2>
        <p>
          Our research demonstrated that neuronal systems exhibit complex
          dynamic behaviors ranging from stable equilibria to limit cycles
          and chaos. The FitzHugh-Nagumo model revealed how neural networks
          can self-regulate chaotic inputs, potentially providing insights
          into brain function and neurological disorders.
